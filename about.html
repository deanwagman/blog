			<h1>A Bit About Me</h1>

			<br />
			<p>
			I'm a Web Developer living in Orlando, Florida.  Currently I work for a large company in Sanford Florida as a Client Support Representative.  The Web Services we offer to our clients use our own custom CMS.  I help them with using the web application and work with other departments in our company to fullfill their needs.</p>

			<p>
			I'm currently looking for a Junior Web Developer position.  Location isn't too important as long as the area has a strong developer community.  This is pretty important to me as I love going to meetups and discussions here in Orlando.  I'm currently a member of the Orlando JavaScript, Front-end Orlando, Wordpress Orlando, and Design Orlando meetups.</p>

			<p>
			I think staying up to date on new web technologies is the most important thing to do. Whether that be through blogs like the popular css-tricks, davidwalsh's blog, DailyJS, Net Magazine or Smashing Magazine.  I also am a big fan of podcasts such as Shop Talk Show, The Dev Show, and of course TED Talks.  Mostly though, I get most of my information via twitter.</p>

			<p>
			As for my tools of the trade, I prefer to use Sublime Text for my code editing as its syntax highlighting and extensions like Emmett and JSLint are rediculously convenient.And let's get real, the themes are pretty cool too.  For CSS preprocessing, I'm on Team Sass, specifically using Compass as it makes it super easy to offer browser cross-compatiablity .  For Version Control, of course I'm using Git, because I'm pretty sure it's gypsy magic. Lately I've been diving into using Gulp as a Build System.  So far I think it's great and can't wait for where the community will take it.</p>

			<p>
			Overall I think I'd be a great addition to your team.  I have a history of Customer Service and having a direct connection with the views of our clients.  I'm addicted to learning and trying new things, all awhile making sure that our clients and customers have the best experience possible.</p>

			<p>
			Feel free to contact me on twitter, or through email.  Also, check out my github profile for my most up to date projects and commits.</p>

			<p>
			Can't Wait to hear from you,</p>

			<p>Dean</p>
